    "### Objective: \n",
    "Postpartum depression is a heterogeneous disorder in phenotype and etiology. Characterizing the longitudinal course of depressive symptoms over the first year after birth and identifying variables that predict distinct symptom trajectories will expedite efficient mental health treatment planning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose was to \n",
    "1. Determine 12-month trajectories of postpartum depressive symptoms\n",
    "2. Identify characteristics that predict the trajectories\n",
    "3. Provide a computational algorithm that predicts specific trajectory membership. "

    "### Analysis Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "The STATA/SAS plugin traj was used for estimating group-based trajectory models of SIGH-ADS29 total score during the first year postpartum. The number of trajectories and the shape of the pattern of change for each over time were determined from the comparison of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and visual fit across all possible models.\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting a final model, we used the newly-created trajectory group membership variable to examine differences for demographic and other potential predictors across these categories.  We employed Pearson’s Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and one-way ANOVA for continuous variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "We created a multinomial logistic regression model with the trajectory group membership as the outcome to assess the capacity of baseline variables to predict one-year postpartum depression trajectories. Each demographic predictor was tested in an unadjusted multinomial logistic regression model. Predictors that were individually statistically significant at the 10% level were assessed in the multivariable model. Development of a final predictive model for trajectory membership employed 10-fold cross validation techniques using a penalized multinomial regression model through the R package CARET (Classification and Regression Training). Variables that remained statistical significant at the 10% level were kept in the reduced model. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Missing covariates were handled by multiple imputation using the R package MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations). The model results were compared with results from complete case analysis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Post hoc analyses compared the two most severe trajectories with respect to the use of health services at baseline, month 6 and month 12 via a series of generalized linear mixed effect models.  In each model the use of health services was regressed on fixed trajectory groups, time, and the trajectory-by-time interaction terms (assuming a 10% level of significance for interaction terms) with an additional random intercept term. Analyses were performed using STATA 27 and R 3.2.0."
